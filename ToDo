- [Feature] [High] Let user set a custom t_eval field for TimeEvaluationSimulation (should be able to hold fields like np.linspace(0, 3600, 300)) 
- [Feature] [High] let user select what outputs they want to see from simulation
- [Cleanup] [High] Add suport to look for bpx models not by string but what is physically availible from a cell library
- [Feature] [Low] Add electrochemical model support for May Particle Model (MPM)
- [Feature] [Med] let the simulator simulate drive cycles
- [Feature] [Low] add JAX solver support.
- [Feature] [Low] Feature to set the mesh and discretise model the electrochemical model.
