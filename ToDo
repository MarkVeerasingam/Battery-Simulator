- [Feature] [High] Let user set a custom t_eval field for TimeEvaluationSimulation (should be able to hold fields like np.linspace(0, 3600, 300)) 
- [Feature] [High] let user select what outputs they want to see from simulation
- [Feature] [Low] Add electrochemical model support for May Particle Model (MPM)
- [Feature] [Med] let the simulator simulate drive cycles
- [Feature] [Low] add JAX solver support.
