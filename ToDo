- [Cleanup] [High] Add suport to look for bpx models not by string but what is physically availible from a cell library
- [Testing] [High] Add try-catch statements to Model.py and Solver.py when making models.
- [Testing] [Med] Look at impletmenting PyTest to test simulations before running them.
- [Testing] [High] Add try-catch statements to Model.py and Solver.py when making models.
- [Testing] [Med] Make validators more thorough for edge cases in Model.py (ties in with config file)

- [Cleanup] [High] Seperate BPX Models and Electrochemical Modes into their own classes.

- [Feature] [High] let user select what outputs they want to see from simulation
- [Feature] [Low] Add electrochemical model support for May Particle Model (MPM)
