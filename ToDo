[Completed]
- [Feature] [High] let the simulator simulate drive cycles - may need to turn model.events = [] 
[In Progress]
- [Feature] [Med] let the user define the drive cycle interpolation parameters/dimensions.

- [Feature] [High] develop cell library on cell types + for models.py
- [Testing] [High] Add try-catch statements to Model.py and Solver.py when making models.
- [Testing] [Med] Look at impletmenting PyTest to test simulations before running them.
- [Testing] [High] Add try-catch statements to Model.py and Solver.py when making models.
- [Testing] [Med] Make validators more thorough for edge cases in Model.py (ties in with config file)

- [Feature] [High] let user select what outputs they want to see from simulation
- [Feature] [Low] Add electrochemical model support for May Particle Model (MPM)
- [Feature] [Low] add JAX solver support.
- [Feature] [Low] Feature to set the mesh and discretise model the electrochemical model.
